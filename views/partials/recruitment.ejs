                                <p> Demand received Once demand is received from clients, a team is assigned to look after the demand type and analyze the kind
                                    and quality of candidates required.
                                    <br> Short listing Through advertising, networks and database, we accumulate the list of candidates for our
                                    clients. A team of professionals goes through their eligibility test and only those who pass the test
                                    would call for interview and further processes.
                                    <br> Selection After short listing of potential selectees, our clients are invited for interview selection
                                    of their preferred workforce. We want accurate tests so that only those candidates who meet requirements
                                    are selected on their merit basis.
                                    <br> Documentation Once a candidate is selected, the documentation process starts thereby timely placement
                                    to selected working field. We do all documentation work-in-house.
                                    <br> Skill up-gradation All the candidates selected by our clients may or may not have previous overseas
                                    work experience on that field. So, we conduct a skill up-gradation training program before they leave
                                    for it. Through vocational trainings, knowledge and attitude build-up courses, we make them ready for
                                    work.
                                    <br> Dispatch After successful skill up-gradation training we send them into the work field.
